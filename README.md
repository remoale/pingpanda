# Event-Monitoring Platform

A full-stack event monitoring platform built with Next.js that delivers real-time Discord notifications, authentication, and subscription billing.

## What I Learned

Building this SaaS-style event monitoring platform taught me:

- **Modern SaaS architecture in Next.js**: Structuring a production-ready app with scalable routing, layouts, and server actions.
- **Authentication & user management**: Implementing secure login flows using **Clerk**.
- **Payments and subscription logic**: Integrating **Stripe** checkout and handling PRO plan upgrades.
- **Real-time event delivery**: Sending instant notifications to **Discord webhooks**.
- **Backend API design**: Building lightweight APIs with **Hono.js** for event ingestion and processing.
- **Database + persistence**: Managing event data with **PostgreSQL** and clean schema design.
- **Type-safe full-stack development**: Keeping everything **100% TypeScript** end-to-end.
- **UI/UX with shadcn + Tailwind**: Creating a clean dashboard and modern landing page.
